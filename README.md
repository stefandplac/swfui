SWF_UI 
Build an online “Support Wheel of Fate”. 
This should select two engineers at random to both complete a half day of support each. 
For the purposes of thistask you are free to assume that we have 10 engineers.

Business RulesThere are some rules and these are liable to change in the future:
● An engineer can do at most one half day shift in a day.
● An engineer cannot have half day shifts on consecutive days.
● Each engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 weekperiod
